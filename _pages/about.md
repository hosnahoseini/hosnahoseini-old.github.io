<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Iâ€™m Hosna, a research assistant at 
    <a href="https://en.sharif.edu/">Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran</a>,<br>
    working at RIML (Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning) under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban.</a><br>
    I received my bachelor's degree from 
    <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/">Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)</a> last year.<br>
    My research focuses on understanding deep learning models, particularly large language models (LLMs) 
    and multimodal models, with the goal of improving their robustness, generalization, and explainability:

        <li>LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</li>
        <li>Generalization & Robustness</li>
        <li>Multimodal Learning</li>
        <li>Explainability & Interpretability</li>
        <li>Cognitive Science</li>
    </ul>
    
    Throughout my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work with 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKjEFukAAAAJ&hl=en">Professor Amir Zamir</a> at EPFL, 
    as well as gaining multiple research experiences at Amirkabir University. I have working experience in:
    
    <ul markdown='1'>
        <li>Multimodality</li>
        <li>Adversarial Learning & Robustness</li>
        <li>Computer Vision</li>
        <li>LLMs and Vision Models (VMs)</li>
    </ul>
    
    In my non-academic life, I enjoy painting, nature walks, and wood carving!
